# Typeset

Typeset is an up-to-date and open-source CSS typeset for article-type content which aims to improve upon the default browser renderings of common HTML elements. It was written specifically to easily integrate into a codebase without much configuration needed beyond theming (e.g. colors or font).

## Usage

Get a copy of `typeset.css` via your preferred method (consider using git if you want updated versions of Typeset streamlined to you) and integrate the file or even just it's contents into your codebase while overwriting defaults to suit your usage.

Also; open `example.html` or visit [my website](https://kikoi.site) for a live example of the typeset properly used.

## Specification

Typeset's styles are written while referencing [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) and [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) with the actual *usage* of the element in mind. Beyond referencing documentation, I seek actual usage of the elements in the web to reference.
